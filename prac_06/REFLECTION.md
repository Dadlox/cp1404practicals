# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've stuck to finishing the program in one sitting instead of extending the time over an unneceessarily long time.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still have the problem of prolonged procrestination, and I am easily distracted from time to time. This lead to the time on task being relatively high (1st one was quick, 2nd one took longer because I procrestinated.)

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I am able to mentally picture what the code would do in my head before I write them down.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to learn to write the code in my mind down as pseudocode because I'm too lazy to write it down. This results in my codes being inconsistant and widly vary in quality.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

None, as of now.
